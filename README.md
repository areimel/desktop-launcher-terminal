### Best Practices ###
* Use lots of comments and documentation
* Keep your tabs lined up correctly
* Follow HTML5 element heirarchy
* Double check your title tags and favicon
* Store your local project in a regular folder with no cloud syncing - this can cause issues with running/building the project

### Initialize ###
* Use Node v10.24.0 (most stable version for project, set with nvm)
* npm run init-setup (runs multiple setup commands)
* npm run dev
